## üìù **DECISION LOG**

### **2024-12-XX: Scope Reduction**
**Decision**: Push back ALL widget rendering to post-launch expansion
**Rationale**: Focus on core game functionality first
**Impact**: Widget rendering moved to Phase 3 (expansion)

### **2024-12-XX: Schematic Editor Integration**
**Decision**: Add schematic editor tools to Dev Sandbox
**Rationale**: Users need tools to create visualizations
**Status**: Completed
