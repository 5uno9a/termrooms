# 01 — Vision

## Purpose
TermRooms reimagines text-based simulation as a **modular, web-native** experience. Creators compose systems using **JSON models**; players interact through **terminal-style panels**.

## Audience
- Curious builders & designers
- Students & educators (systems thinking)
- Indie devs prototyping simulations

## Core Philosophy
1. **Simplicity first** — declarative over imperative.
2. **Modularity** — every layer is replaceable.
3. **Transparency** — visible state and logs.
4. **Collaboration** — multi-user rooms (later).

## Outcomes (v1)
- Working Dev Sandbox
- ReactorSim sample model
- Clean UI shell + docs

> Build a language for simulation that feels like engineering, not programming.
