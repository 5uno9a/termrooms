# 01 — Vision & Elevator Pitch

## Elevator Pitch (≤75 words)
Create collaborative terminal rooms with real-time multiplayer simulations. Build and share interactive games using JSON-based models, starting with ReactorSim—a nuclear reactor management game. TermRooms combines communication, game engine, and dev sandbox in one accessible platform that teaches systems thinking through terminal interfaces.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Terminal-First** — All interactions through familiar slash commands
2. **Simulation-Driven** — Interactive games and simulations as core experience
3. **Real-Time Collaboration** — Multi-user rooms with live state updates
4. **Modular Design** — JSON-based game models for easy creation and sharing
5. **Educational Focus** — Systems thinking through hands-on simulation

## Target Audience
- **Students & Educators** — Learning systems thinking and real-time web development
- **Game Developers** — Terminal-based game creation and sharing
- **Engineers** — Interactive simulation and modeling tools
- **Accessibility Users** — Terminal-style interface with full keyboard support

## Success Metrics
- Users can create and join rooms within 30 seconds
- Real-time updates appear within 200ms
- 100% keyboard accessibility compliance
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Mobile-responsive on all screen sizes

## Long-term Vision
TermRooms serves as a foundation for understanding modern web development patterns while providing immediate utility for collaborative work. The terminal interface makes it accessible to developers while the real-time features demonstrate advanced web technologies.
