# TermRooms - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

TermRooms is a web-based game creation platform where developers build terminal-based simulations using JSON models, and players join temporary game instances to collaborate on interactive challenges. The platform features a built-in dev sandbox for creating games like ReactorSim—a nuclear reactor management simulation—and a game library where players can discover and join public or private game instances.

## Interactive Elements

This project satisfies the course requirement for interactivity by enabling users to:
- Create and publish terminal-based simulation games using the dev sandbox
- Join game instances by ID/password and collaborate in real-time
- Build custom games with draggable panels and ASCII/Unicode widgets
- Share games publicly or keep them private
- Experience hands-on systems thinking through multiplayer simulations

## Technical Approach

Built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind for the frontend, Node.js + Socket.IO for real-time communication, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The platform uses a JSON-based game engine with a gridstack panel system for creating interactive dashboards. Deployed via GitHub Pages (frontend) and Render (backend).

## Learning Outcomes

Demonstrates modern web development practices including real-time communication, game engine architecture, collaborative interfaces, and educational simulation design. The project showcases advanced UI patterns with draggable panels, ASCII visualization, and multiplayer coordination.
