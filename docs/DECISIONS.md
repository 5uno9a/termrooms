## 2024-12-XX: Documentation Structure Overhaul

### Decision
**Consolidate 29 markdown files into 6 essential documents following industry standards**

### Context
The project had 29 scattered markdown files with inconsistent structure, redundant content, and poor organization. This violated industry best practices for documentation.

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Keep Current Structure
- **Pros**: No migration effort

#### Option 2: Minimal Documentation
- **Pros**: Less maintenance
- **Cons**: Insufficient information for developers and users

#### Option 3: Industry Standard Structure
- **Pros**: Professional, maintainable, clear navigation
- **Cons**: Migration effort required

### Decision
**Industry standard documentation structure with 6 core documents**

### Rationale
1. **Maintainability**: Clear structure and naming conventions
2. **Professionalism**: Industry-standard format for web applications
3. **Clarity**: Consistent organization and navigation
4. **Efficiency**: Reduced redundancy and improved findability

### New Structure
- **README.md**: Project overview and quick start
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design and components
- **docs/API.md**: REST and WebSocket API reference
- **docs/GAME_ENGINE.md**: JSON-based game system documentation
- **docs/DEVELOPMENT.md**: Setup, contribution, and development guide
- **docs/DECISIONS.md**: This decision log

### Implementation
- Consolidated 29 files into 6 essential documents
- Removed all emojis for professional appearance
- Standardized formatting and structure
- Added comprehensive cross-references

### Consequences

## 2024-12-XX: Client-Side Rendering Architecture

### Decision
**Client-side rendering with server-side state management**

### Context
The team needed to decide where to implement the widget and panel rendering system - whether on the server (server-side rendering) or client (client-side rendering).

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- **Pros**: 
  - Centralized rendering logic
  - Consistent output across all clients
  - Server controls all visual aspects
- **Cons**: 
  - High server load for multiple clients
  - Network bandwidth for rendered content
  - Less responsive UI updates
  - Difficult to implement real-time interactions

#### Option 2: Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- **Pros**: 
  - Better performance and responsiveness
  - Real-time interactions possible
  - Reduced server load
  - Better user experience
- **Cons**: 
  - Rendering logic duplicated across clients
  - Potential for visual inconsistencies
  - More complex state synchronization

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Pros**: 
  - Best of both worlds
  - Server validates and processes, client renders
- **Cons**: 
  - More complex architecture
  - Additional synchronization overhead

### Decision
**Client-side rendering with server-side state management**

### Rationale
1. **Performance**: Real-time multiplayer games require low latency and high responsiveness
2. **Scalability**: Server only needs to manage game state, not render for every client
3. **User Experience**: Immediate visual feedback for user actions
4. **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns - server manages logic, client handles presentation
5. **Future-proofing**: Easier to add animations, custom themes, and advanced visual features

### Implementation Plan
1. **Server**: Sends game state updates via WebSocket
2. **Client**: Receives state updates and re-renders widgets
3. **State Binding**: Variables and entities are bound to widget configurations
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket triggers re-rendering when state changes

### Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - Responsive real-time updates
  - Scalable architecture
  - Rich client-side interactions
- **Negative**: 
  - More complex client-side code
  - Need to ensure visual consistency
  - Additional testing for different clients

## 2024-12-XX: Widget System Architecture

### Decision
**Modular widget renderer system with three levels of customization**

### Context
Need to design how JSON widget configurations translate to actual visual output.

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Hardcoded Widget Types
- **Pros**: Simple implementation
- **Cons**: Not extensible, limited customization

#### Option 2: Template-Based System
- **Pros**: Pre-defined visualizations, easy to use
- **Cons**: Limited flexibility for advanced users

#### Option 3: Custom ASCII Art System
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, user creativity
- **Cons**: Complex to implement and validate

#### Option 4: Hybrid Modular System
- **Pros**: Multiple levels of customization, extensible
- **Cons**: More complex architecture

### Decision
**Hybrid modular system with three levels of customization**

### Rationale
1. **Accessibility**: Easy templates for beginners
2. **Flexibility**: Custom ASCII art for advanced users
3. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for new widget types
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Implementation Levels
1. **Level 1**: Static templates (pre-defined visualizations)
2. **Level 2**: Custom ASCII art with variable bindings
3. **Level 3**: Custom JavaScript renderers

### Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - Caters to all skill levels
  - Highly extensible
  - Rich visual possibilities
- **Negative**: 
  - Complex implementation
  - More testing required
  - Security considerations for custom code

## 2024-12-XX: Real-time Communication Protocol

### Decision
**WebSocket with JSON state synchronization**

### Context
Need to choose how to synchronize game state between server and multiple clients in real-time.

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: REST API Polling
- **Pros**: Simple to implement
- **Cons**: High latency, inefficient, not real-time

#### Option 2: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Pros**: Real-time updates, simple
- **Cons**: One-way communication only

#### Option 3: WebSocket
- **Pros**: Bidirectional, real-time, efficient
- **Cons**: More complex connection management

#### Option 4: WebRTC
- **Pros**: Peer-to-peer, very low latency
- **Cons**: Complex setup, not suitable for server-authoritative games

### Decision
**WebSocket with JSON state synchronization**

### Rationale
1. **Real-time**: Immediate updates for all players
2. **Bidirectional**: Clients can send actions, server sends state
3. **Efficient**: Only send changed data
4. **Standard**: Well-supported across browsers
5. **Server Authority**: Server maintains authoritative game state

### Implementation
- **Server**: Socket.IO for WebSocket management
- **Client**: Socket.IO client for connection handling
- **Protocol**: JSON messages for state updates and actions
- **State Sync**: Full state on connect, incremental updates

### Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - Real-time multiplayer experience
  - Efficient bandwidth usage
  - Reliable connection management
- **Negative**: 
  - More complex than REST
  - Connection state management required
  - Need to handle reconnections

## 2024-12-XX: Game State Management

### Decision
**Server-authoritative with client prediction**

### Context
How to handle game state in a multiplayer environment where multiple clients can perform actions.

### Options Considered

#### Option 1: Client-Authoritative
- **Pros**: Immediate responsiveness
- **Cons**: Cheating possible, state conflicts

#### Option 2: Server-Authoritative
- **Pros**: Secure, consistent state
- **Cons**: Higher latency, less responsive

#### Option 3: Hybrid (Server-Authoritative with Client Prediction)
- **Pros**: Security + responsiveness
- **Cons**: More complex, rollback needed

### Decision
**Server-authoritative with client prediction**

### Rationale
1. **Security**: Server validates all actions
2. **Consistency**: Single source of truth
3. **Responsiveness**: Client shows predicted results immediately
4. **Rollback**: Client can correct if server disagrees

### Implementation
- **Server**: Validates and processes all actions
- **Client**: Shows immediate feedback, corrects on server response
- **State**: Server sends authoritative state updates
- **Actions**: Client sends actions, server processes and broadcasts results

### Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - Secure multiplayer
  - Responsive UI
  - Consistent game state
- **Negative**: 
  - Complex rollback logic
  - Network dependency
  - More testing required
